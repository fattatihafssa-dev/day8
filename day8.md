Day 8 Challenge Bank — Strings
Challenge 1 — Username Generator
Context: A sign-up form needs to auto-generate a username from a new user's first and last name, in the format firstname.lastname, all lowercase.

Task: Write generateUsername(firstName, lastName) that returns the formatted username using a template literal.

Example:

console.log(generateUsername("Yassine", "Bahajou"));
Output:

yassine.bahajou
Challenge 2 — Initials Extractor
Context: A messaging app shows a colored circle with a user's initials when they have no profile picture.

Task: Write getInitials(fullName) that takes a full name (any number of words) and returns the uppercase first letter of each word, with no spaces or separators.

Example:

console.log(getInitials("Yassine Bahajou"));
console.log(getInitials("Sara Amine El Idrissi"));
Output:

YB
SAEI
Challenge 3 — Email Domain Finder
Context: A support tool needs to group customer tickets by email provider (gmail, outlook, etc.).

Task: Write getDomain(email) that returns everything after the @ symbol.

Example:

console.log(getDomain("yassine.bahajou@gmail.com"));
Output:

gmail.com
Challenge 4 — Vowel Counter
Context: A typing-practice app scores how "vowel-heavy" a phrase is, for a fun statistics screen.

Task: Write countVowels(str) that counts how many characters in str are vowels (a, e, i, o, u, upper or lower case).

Example:

console.log(countVowels("JavaScript Bootcamp"));
Output:

6
Challenge 5 — Word Counter
Context: A blogging platform shows a live word count under the post editor as the writer types.

Task: Write countWords(sentence) that returns the number of words in a sentence, assuming words are separated by single spaces.

Example:

console.log(countWords("Learning JavaScript is fun and rewarding"));
Output:

6
Challenge 6 — Character Frequency Counter
Context: A word game needs to know how many times a specific letter appears in a word, to validate a player's guess.

Task: Write countCharacter(str, target) that counts how many times the single character target appears in str.

Example:

console.log(countCharacter("mississippi", "s"));
Output:

4
Challenge 7 — Longest Word Finder
Context: A headline generator wants to detect the longest word in a sentence, to make sure it doesn't overflow a narrow banner.

Task: Write longestWord(sentence) that returns the longest word in the sentence. If there's a tie, return whichever comes first.

Example:

console.log(longestWord("The quick brown fox jumps over a lazy dog"));
Output:

quick
Challenge 8 — Palindrome Checker
Context: A word-puzzle app wants to detect palindromes — phrases that read the same forwards and backwards, ignoring spaces and case.

Task: Write isPalindrome(str) that returns true or false. Reuse a manual reverseString helper (from today's veille) and a helper that strips spaces — no shortcuts.

Example:

console.log(isPalindrome("radar"));
console.log(isPalindrome("was it a car or a cat i saw"));
console.log(isPalindrome("hello"));
Output:

true
true
false
Challenge 9 — Count Keyword Occurrences
Context: A simple SEO tool counts how many times a keyword appears in an article, to flag "keyword stuffing".

Task: Write countOccurrences(text, keyword) that counts how many times keyword appears in text, including overlapping or repeated matches. Use slice inside a loop to compare a moving window against keyword — no indexOf-in-a-loop shortcuts.

Example:

console.log(countOccurrences("the cat sat on the mat with the hat", "the"));
Output:

3
Challenge 10 — Normalize Whitespace
Context: A search box needs to clean up messy user input — extra spaces from copy-pasting — before running a search.

Task: Write normalizeSpaces(str) that removes leading/trailing whitespace and collapses any run of multiple spaces between words down to exactly one space. Build the result manually — no .join().

Example:

console.log("[" + normalizeSpaces("  Hello    World   from   YouCode  ") + "]");
Output:

[Hello World from YouCode]
Challenge 11 — Title Case Converter
Context: A blog CMS auto-formats post titles so every word starts with a capital letter, no matter how the writer typed it.

Task: Write toTitleCase(sentence) that capitalizes the first letter of every word in a sentence and lowercases nothing else (assume the rest of each word is already fine).

Example:

console.log(toTitleCase("javascript bootcamp at youcode sas"));
Output:

Javascript Bootcamp At Youcode Sas
Challenge 12 — Anagram Checker
Context: A word game wants to verify whether two phrases use exactly the same letters, just rearranged — a classic anagram check.

Task: Write isAnagram(str1, str2) that returns true if the two strings (ignoring spaces and case) contain exactly the same characters the same number of times, false otherwise. Build a character-frequency object for each string (like Day 7's accumulator pattern), then compare them.

Example:

console.log(isAnagram("listen", "silent"));
console.log(isAnagram("the eyes", "they see"));
console.log(isAnagram("hello", "world"));
Output:

true
true
false
Challenge 13 — Caesar Cipher Shift
Context: A simple encoding tool shifts every letter of a lowercase message forward by one position in the alphabet — a becomes b, z wraps back around to a.

Task: Write caesarShift(str) that shifts every letter in str forward by one, leaving non-letters (like spaces) unchanged. Use a string "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" as a lookup alphabet with indexOf and bracket access — no character-code methods.

Example:

console.log(caesarShift("hello world"));
console.log(caesarShift("youcode"));
Output:

ifmmp xpsme
zpvdpef
Challenge 14 — Reverse Word Order
Context: A quirky text-effect feature flips the order of words in a sentence (not the letters within each word) for a "backwards talk" filter.

Task: Write reverseWordOrder(sentence) that returns the sentence with its words in reverse order, each word itself unchanged.

Example:

console.log(reverseWordOrder("JavaScript is fun to learn"));
Output:

learn to fun is JavaScript
Challenge 15 — Student Report Generator
Context: A small school app needs a one-line report per student, combining their name, computed average, and a letter grade — pulling together objects, arrays, functions, and strings all at once.

Task: Write buildReport(student), where student is an object like { name: "imane", scores: [14, 18, 16] }. Compute the average of scores, determine a grade (Excellent ≥ 16, Good ≥ 12, Pass ≥ 10, else Fail), and return a single formatted string using a template literal, with the name in uppercase.

Example:

console.log(buildReport({ name: "imane", scores: [14, 18, 16] }));
console.log(buildReport({ name: "karim", scores: [6, 9, 9] }));
Output:

IMANE — Average: 16 — Grade: Excellent
KARIM — Average: 8 — Grade: Fail
