Final Project SAS 2: Election and Electoral Roll Management in Morocco
Introduction
Build an application to manage an election campaign. The application will manage candidate lists, record votes, and display detailed statistics about the election.

Project Context
The application must have a main menu allowing the following operations:

1. Add a new candidate
A candidate is defined by a unique identifier (e.g. national ID / CIN), a last name, a first name, a political party (or "Independent"), their age, and a list of the national IDs of the people who voted for them (voters) (array initially empty).

const candidates = [{
	cin: "AB123456",
	lastName: "Boushaba",
	firstName: "Soufiane",
	politicalParty: "Independent",
	age: 40,
	voters: []
}];
2. Add several candidates at once
3. Display the list of candidates
Display full details (ID, last name, first name, political party, age, number of votes (calculated from the list of voters' national IDs)) according to several views:

Sort candidates by number of votes (descending order, to see the winners).
Filter and display only the candidates from a specific political party.
# Candidate 1:
CIN: AB12345
Name: Alae
-------------
# Candidate 2:
CIN: AB12345
Name: Alae
-------------
4. Vote for a candidate
Ask the voter to enter their own national ID.
Check whether the voter is allowed to vote (i.e. whether their national ID does not already appear in any candidate's list of voters).
Ask for the candidate's ID or national ID, then add the voter's national ID to that candidate's list of voters.
If the voter's national ID already exists in a list of voters, display the message:

"You have already voted and you are not allowed to change your vote or vote again."

5. Edit a candidate's information
Change a candidate's political party.
Change a candidate's age.
6. Delete a candidate
Remove a candidate from the list by their national ID (e.g. withdrawal of candidacy).
7. Search for candidates
Search for a candidate by their last name.
8. Election statistics
Display the total number of candidates.
Display the total number of votes cast in the entire election.
Display the Top 3 candidates with the most votes.
Display the number of candidates per political party.
N.B.: The user must return to the main menu after each operation.

Technical Requirements
The project must be built in JavaScript with Node.js.

The concepts primarily expected are:

variables and constants;
operators;
if / else;
switch;
for;
while;
functions;
arrays;
objects;
arrays of objects;
string manipulation.
The following JavaScript methods may be used, notably:

push()
splice()
find()
findIndex()
includes()
filter()
map()
